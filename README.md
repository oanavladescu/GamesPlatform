## Challenge 1

Displays an alert box when the user clicks on the blue button, asking for his birth year. After confirmation, the dedicated function does a math calculation and displays the answer in the result box.

## Challenge 2

Displays a cat gif every time the user click on the green button. The result box uses display: flex property to make sure the content is displayed evenly.
If the user hits "delete", all the images will be removed from the div.

## Challenge 3

Represents a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, where the user is compiting angainst the computer. All you need to is select an image and be lucky. Don't worry if you lose, the "restart" button is there to give you another chance.

This challenge offers 4 options based on which all the buttons from the web app will be colored: 
* random - gives each button a random color (from the colors displayed in the beginning),
* green - makes all buttons green,
* red - makes all buttons red,
* reset - makes the buttons look like there were in the beginning.

This blackjack game has it all: nice cards images, sounds and an incredible logic, that won't late you cheat. You can either play against the computer (default mode), or in 2 player mode (those lines of code are commented, but I specified what you have to do in order to enable this future).
